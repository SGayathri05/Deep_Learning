# About this Repository
This Repository contains basic programs on the Deep Learning and Computer Vision too.

# Deep_Learning
Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves the training of artificial neural networks to perform tasks without explicit programming. It is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, consisting of interconnected layers of nodes (neurons) that process information. The above attached programs are implemented using Deep Learning concepts.

# Computer Vision
Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines to interpret, understand, and make decisions based on visual data. It seeks to replicate the human visual system's ability to extract meaningful information from images or videos.This Jupyter Notebook consists of following subtopics.

## Key Concepts in CV:

| Image Processing | Computer Vision involves various image processing techniques to enhance, analyze, and manipulate visual data. Operations include filtering, segmentation, and feature extraction. |

| Feature Extraction | Features are distinctive patterns or structures in an image. Computer Vision algorithms extract features to understand the content of an image and recognize objects. |

| Object Detection | Identifying and locating objects within an image or video stream. Popular techniques include region-based methods, like R-CNN, and single-shot methods, like YOLO. |

| Image Classification | Categorizing images into predefined classes or labels. Deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have excelled in image classification tasks. |
